                <p>
                    Once upon a younger year <br>
                    When all our shadows disappeared <br>
                    The animals inside came out to play <br>
                    Went face to face with all our fears <br>
                    Learned our lessons through the tears <br>
                    Made <span class="keywords">memories</span> we knew would never fade <br>
                    One day, my father, he told me, <strong>"Son, don't let it slip away"</strong> <br>
                    He took me in his arms, I heard him say <br>
                    "Think of me if ever you're <span class="keywords">afraid</span>" <br>
                    He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind <br>
                    So <span class="keywords">live a life</span> you will remember" <br>
                    My father told me when I was just a child <br>
                    "These are the nights that never die" <br>
                </p>

            <div class="col">
                <p>
                    "When thunderclouds start pouring down <br>
                    Light a fire they can't put out <br>
                    Carve your name into those <span class="keywords">shining stars</span>" <br>
                    He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores <br>
                    I'll guide you home no matter where you are" <br>
                    One day, my father, he told me, <strong>"Son, don't let it slip away"</strong> <br>
                    When I was just a <span class="keywords">kid</span>, I heard him say <br>
                    "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days <br>
                    Think of me if ever you're afraid" <br>
                    He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind <br>
                    So live a life you will remember" <br>
                    My father told me when I was just a child <br>
                    <strong>"These are the <span class="keywords">nights</span> that never die" </strong><br>
